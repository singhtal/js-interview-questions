1. ### What are the primitive data types in javascript

   These six types are considered to be primitives. A primitive is not an object and has no methods
   of its own. All primitives are immutable.

1. **String:** Collection of characters i.e words.

2. **Number:** integers, floats, etc.

3. **Boolean** true or false

4. **Null** no value. However, the typeof(null) is an object in javascript/

5. **Undefined** a declared variable but hasnâ€™t been given a value.

6. **Symbol** a unique value that's not equal to any other value.
