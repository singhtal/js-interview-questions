1. ### What are the primitive data types in javascript

   These six types are considered to be primitives. A primitive is not an object and has no methods
   of its own. All primitives are immutable.

    1. **String:** Collection of characters i.e words.

    2. **Number:** integers, floats, etc.

    3. **Boolean** true or false

    4. **Null** no value. However, the typeof(null) is an object in javascript/

    5. **Undefined** a declared variable but hasnâ€™t been given a value.

    6. **Symbol** a unique value that's not equal to any other value.

2. ### What is the symbol data type

    The JavaScript ES6 introduced a new primitive data type called Symbol. Symbols are immutable (cannot be changed) and are unique. For example -

    ```javascript
    // two symbols with the same description

    const value1 = Symbol('hello');
    const value2 = Symbol('hello');

    console.log(value1 === value2); // false
    ```
    Though value1 and value2 both contain the same description, they are different.

    #### Creating Symbol

    Use the Symbol() function to create a Symbol. For example -

    ```javascript
    // creating symbol
    const z = Symbol()
    typeof z; // symbol
    ```
    Type of a symbol is a symbol.

    You can pass an optional string as its description.

    ```javascript
    const z = Symbol('hello');
    console.log(z); // Symbol(hello)
    console.log(z.description); // hello
    ```
    -----
    #### Add Symbol as an Object Key
    You can add symbols as a key in an object using square brackets []. For example -

    ```javascript
    let id = Symbol("id");

    let person = {
        name: "John",

        // adding symbol as a key
        [id]: 123 // not "id": 123
    };

    console.log(person); // {name: "John", Symbol(id): 123}
    ```

    Note: Symbols are not included in for...in Loop

    #### So what is the benefit of using symbol ?

    If the same code is used multiple times, then it is better to use Symbols in the object key. It's because you can use the same key name in different codes and avoid duplication issues. For example -

    ```javascript
    let person = {
        name: "Jack"
    };

    // creating Symbol
    let id = Symbol("id");

    // adding symbol as a key
    person[id] = 23; 
    ```

    In the above program, if the person object is also used by another program, then you wouldn't want to add a property that can be accessed or changed by another program. Hence by using Symbol, you create a unique property that you can use.
